# cs16

CS16 taught me the basics of writing code in C++.  

What I learned:
- basic control structures (loops, if/else statements)
- data types (int , double, char, string, bool, etc.)
- defining functions
- structs to develop new variable types
- conversion from binary to decimal and hex and vice versa
- passing parameters using references, pointers, or by value
- relationships between arrays and pointers
